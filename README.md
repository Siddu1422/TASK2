DESCRIPTION:The game starts by displaying an empty board, where players take turns entering their moves by selecting a cell numbered from 1 to 9. 
The program validates each move, ensuring it falls within the valid range and the selected cell is unoccupied
After each move, the game checks for a winner by examining rows, columns, and diagonals for a complete sequence of Xs or Os.
If a winner is found, the game declares the winning player. If the board is full without a winner, the game ends in a draw.
This implementation provides a simple yet functional version of Tic Tac Toe, suitable for learning purposes or casual gameplay.
It demonstrates key concepts of game development, such as board representation, player input validation, and win condition checks.
CONCLUSION:This implementation serves as an excellent starting point for understanding fundamental concepts of game development, including board representation,
player input validation,
and win condition checks. Additionally, it demonstrates the use of loops, conditionals, and functions in Python programming.
While the code provides a simple version of Tic Tac Toe suitable for learning purposes or casual gameplay, there's room for expansion and improvement. Future enhancements
could include adding a graphical user interface (GUI), implementing an AI opponent using algorithms like minimax, or incorporating additional features such as player statistics or a replay option.
Overall, this Tic Tac Toe implementation offers a practical example for beginners to learn about game development in Python and can be further customized and extended to create more sophisticated games.
